    @template block_ai_chat/toast_wrapper

    This is a replacement for core/local/toast/wrapper.

    We need the toast region to be relative to the chat block, so we cannot use the core "fixed-top"
    bootstrap class, but have to use this customized toast wrapper.

    Example context (json):
    {
    }
}}
<div class="toast-wrapper mx-auto py-0 top-0 position-absolute start-50 translate-middle-x" role="status" aria-live="polite"></div>
